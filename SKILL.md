# Prophetic Critique Method

Speak truth to power effectively by calling institutions, nations, or movements to account while acknowledging your own complicity - the prophetic voice that speaks from within, not above.

---

## When to Use

- An institution, nation, or movement needs to be held accountable
- Self-righteousness or injustice requires public naming
- Speaking truth to power is necessary but must avoid self-righteousness
- Someone asks "How do I hold power accountable?" or "This is unjust, what do I say?"
- A situation requires moral courage but also epistemic humility
- The user wants to critique without falling into the trap of claiming innocence

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| target | Yes | The institution, nation, movement, or power structure being critiqued |
| failure | Yes | The specific injustice, failure, or betrayal being named |
| context | No | The speaker's relationship to the target (insider, outsider, affected party) |
| audience | No | Who needs to hear this critique |
| stakes | No | What's at risk if the critique is not heard |

## The Prophetic Critique Framework

Prophetic critique is distinct from mere criticism. The prophet speaks from within the tradition, appeals to its highest values, names specific failures, acknowledges the difficulty of change, and calls to concrete action - all while recognizing their own implication in the very problems they diagnose.

### What Makes Critique "Prophetic"

| Prophetic Critique | Mere Criticism |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Speaks from within | Stands above |
| Appeals to shared values | Imposes external standards |
| Names specific failures | Makes general accusations |
| Acknowledges complicity | Claims innocence |
| Calls to concrete action | Demands abstract change |
| Serves the institution's true purpose | Destroys the institution |
| Maintains relationship | Burns bridges |

### The Prophet's Authority

The prophet has authority because:
1. They speak from genuine commitment to the tradition
2. They bear the cost of their words
3. They do not claim moral superiority
4. They name what others see but fear to say
5. They offer a path forward, not just condemnation

### The Key Insight

> "Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves." — Reinhold Niebuhr

## The Five Elements of Prophetic Critique

### 1. Speak From Within

Establish your standing in the community, institution, or tradition you are critiquing. You speak not as a self-righteous outsider but as one who shares in the identity and is therefore implicated.

**Questions to ask:**
- What is my relationship to this institution/tradition?
- What do I love about it that makes its failure painful?
- How am I part of the problem I'm naming?

### 2. Name Specific Failures

Vague accusations are easy to dismiss. Name the specific actions, policies, or patterns that betray the institution's own stated values.

**Questions to ask:**
- What exactly has been done or not done?
- Who specifically has been harmed?
- What values are being betrayed?
- What evidence supports the critique?

### 3. Appeal to Shared Values

The most powerful critique appeals to values the target already claims. You are not imposing foreign standards but holding the institution accountable to its own professed commitments.

**Questions to ask:**
- What values does this institution/tradition claim?
- How do current failures betray those values?
- What would living up to those values require?

### 4. Acknowledge the Difficulty

Change is hard. Systems are complex. Good people can participate in bad systems. Acknowledging this prevents self-righteousness and opens space for genuine response.

**Questions to ask:**
- What makes change genuinely difficult here?
- What constraints do people face?
- What would the costs of change be?

### 5. Call to Concrete Action

Abstract calls for "doing better" accomplish nothing. Specify what should be done, by whom, and when. Give people a way to respond.

**Questions to ask:**
- What specific action is being called for?
- Who needs to take this action?
- What would success look like?
- What is the first step?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "My company talks constantly about diversity and inclusion but just promoted three white men to the executive team while passing over several qualified women and people of color. I want to say something but don't want to be dismissed as just being bitter."

**Output:**

## Prophetic Critique

### Speaking From Within
I write as someone who has given years to this company and believes in what we could become. I've benefited from the opportunities here, and I recognize that my speaking up now carries its own complications - I can be dismissed as self-interested, and I know my perspective is partial.

But I also write as someone who has watched colleagues of extraordinary talent cycle through this organization without advancing, while we publicly celebrate our commitment to diversity. If I stay silent, I become complicit in the very failure I see.

### The Failure Being Named
**The Specific Wrongdoing:** In our most recent executive promotions, we selected three individuals who share the same demographic profile as the existing executive team, while passing over candidates with strong qualifications and track records who would have diversified leadership.

**The Harm Caused:** Beyond the individuals passed over - who received the message that excellence is insufficient - we harm everyone who sees leadership and concludes they have no future here. We harm our company's ability to attract talent. We harm our capacity to understand and serve diverse markets. We harm ourselves by limiting the perspectives at the table.

**The Pattern:** This is not an isolated incident. Our pipeline looks diverse at entry level and narrows dramatically with each promotion tier. We have data showing this pattern for years.

### The Values Betrayed
**What We Claim:** Our values statement commits us to "building leadership that reflects the diversity of our customers and communities." Our CEO's recent speech emphasized that "diverse leadership isn't just right - it's essential to our success."

**What We Do:** When it comes to actual promotion decisions, we consistently select candidates who match the existing demographic profile, often citing "culture fit" or "executive presence" - criteria that systematically favor those who already look like leadership.

**The Gap:** The distance between our stated values and our actual decisions has become untenable. We cannot claim to value diversity while our actions demonstrate the opposite.

### The Difficulty Acknowledged
I know this is hard. Executive selection involves complex factors I may not fully understand. The promoted individuals are not unqualified - they are colleagues I respect. Unconscious bias is, by definition, invisible to those who hold it. And no one wants to be told they made decisions shaped by bias rather than pure merit.

The systems that produce these outcomes were not designed to be exclusionary - they simply reflect assumptions built over decades that need to be examined and changed. This is work that requires courage, not villains to blame.

### The Call to Action
**Immediate:** Conduct a genuine review of this promotion cycle - not to reverse decisions, but to understand the criteria used and how they may have systematically disadvantaged certain candidates.

**Structural:** Implement objective criteria for executive selection. Require diverse candidate slates. Create accountability for promotion outcomes at the leadership level. Tie executive compensation to measurable diversity progress.

**Personal:** Every leader involved in promotion decisions should examine their own assumptions about "executive presence" and "culture fit." What do these terms mean? Who do they advantage? Are they actually correlated with performance?

### The Hope
We could be the company we claim to be. We have talented people at every level who could lead if given the opportunity. We have the resources to make change. We have stated the values - now we need the courage to live them.

This critique is offered not to condemn but to call us back to our own stated commitments. I remain here because I believe we can do better. The question is whether we will.

## What This Method Does NOT Do

- Claim moral innocence for the critic
- Attack individuals rather than patterns and systems
- Impose external values rather than appeal to professed ones
- Demand perfection rather than meaningful change
- Burn bridges that could support dialogue
- Speak from above rather than from within

---

## Integration

This skill is derived from the **Reinhold Niebuhr** expert persona. It embodies the prophetic stance he advocated: critique that speaks truth to power while acknowledging one's own implication in the structures being critiqued. Use it when moral courage is needed but self-righteousness must be avoided.
